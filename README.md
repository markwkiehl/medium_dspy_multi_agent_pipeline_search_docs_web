Multi-agent pipeline using DSPy


Multi-Agent DSPy RAG and Web Search PipelineThis repository contains a Python script that implements a sophisticated, agentic pipeline for answering complex user queries. It strategically combines information retrieved from a local document database (using a hybrid RAG system) and the external web (via the Tavily search tool).The core goal of the pipeline is to break down a difficult, multi-hop question into manageable steps, execute the necessary searches (local or web) for each step, and synthesize the findings into a single, cohesive final answer.1. Summary of the Script (api_lllm_dspy_agentic_pipeline_v1.0.2.py)The script utilizes the DSPy framework to orchestrate a team of specialized agents, ensuring efficient and accurate information retrieval.How the Pipeline WorksDecomposition: The initial complex user_query is fed to the MasterPlanAgent, which breaks it down into a list of smaller, targeted master_plan_query steps.Iterative Search: The pipeline iterates through these steps. For each step, it attempts to find an answer by first querying the local document database, and then (if necessary) querying the external web.Local RAG System: The local document search uses a Hybrid Retriever (LangChain's EnsembleRetriever), which combines:Vector Search (Chroma): Semantic search based on embeddings (text-embedding-3-small).Keyword Search (BM25): Sparse retrieval for exact term matching.The combined results are re-ranked using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).Web Search: The web search utilizes the TavilySearch tool.Early Termination: Crucially, the RawContentCheckAgent immediately analyzes the raw, unsummarized search results against the original user query. If the complete answer is found at any point, the entire pipeline terminates early, maximizing efficiency and minimizing cost.Refinement and Synthesis: If early termination doesn't occur, the ReflectAgent determines if a step is complete. Once all steps are complete, the FinalizeMasterPlanAgent takes all partial summaries and synthesizes them into the final response.Core AgentsDSPy Agent ModuleFunctionMasterPlanAgentDecomposes the complex user query into a series of actionable steps.SearchDocsAgentExecutes the hybrid RAG search against local documents (Chroma + BM25) and summarizes the findings for a specific step.SearchWebAgentExecutes the web search using the Tavily tool and summarizes the findings for a specific step.RawContentCheckAgentChecks the raw search results (local or web) against the original user query to enable early pipeline termination.ReflectAgentEvaluates if a given step's search history is sufficient to answer that step's query.FinalizeStepAgentSynthesizes a final, factual summary for one completed step.FinalizeMasterPlanAgentSynthesizes all individual step summaries into the single, final answer for the user's overall query.2. Configuration and SetupPrerequisitesYou need access to two external services:OpenAI: For the Large Language Model (LLM) and for the embedding model (text-embedding-3-small).Tavily: For fast, relevant web search grounding.Step 1: Install DependenciesThe script relies on several Python libraries, specifically pinned to the versions you provided for maximum compatibility.Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the packages:# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate
# Activate the environment (Windows)
# .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install the required packages
pip install dspy==3.0.4 \
            langchain==1.1.0 \
            langchain-chroma==1.0.0 \
            langchain-classic==1.0.0 \
            langchain-community==0.4.1 \
            langchain-core==1.1.0 \
            langchain-openai==1.1.0 \
            langchain-tavily==0.2.13 \
            openai==2.8.1 \
            rank-bm25==0.2.2 \
            python-dotenv \
            rich
Step 2: Configure API KeysThe script uses environment variables, loaded from a .env file, to securely manage API keys.Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project (next to the Python script).Add the following lines to your .env file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:# Get your key from OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# Get your key from Tavily
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"
Step 3: Running the ScriptYou can now execute the Python pipeline. The script includes a placeholder local document set (a fake biography of Christopher Diaz) and example queries that demonstrate both local RAG and web search capabilities.python api_lllm_dspy_agentic_pipeline_v1.0.2.py
The script will print the execution trace, including the steps generated by the MasterPlanAgent, the search results from the local RAG and Tavily, and the final synthesized answer.
